# food_orders_store_presentation_screen

An application that simulate clients ordering dishes.
The client order one or more dishes in the store.
The dishes are cooked.
When the dishes are ready, they are put into an oven for a certain amount of time
to maintain them at the right temperature and awaiting for the client to retrieve his/her order.
Once the countdown is over, if the client has retrieve his/her order, then an oven is free to receive a new order. if not, the dishes are removed from the oven, and a new dishe replace the old one.(This part hasn't been implemented).
This app shows a representation of the locker where all the oven are placed and the screen is supposed to be placed where every customer can see if there orders are ready and how many times left before it's removed from oven.
